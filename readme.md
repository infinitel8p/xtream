## Features

- **Two backends, one UI.** Sign in with Xtream Codes credentials (host / port / user / pass) or paste a direct `.m3u` / `.m3u8` URL. The app detects the mode automatically.
- **Live TV** with category filtering, channel search, virtualised list, and inline EPG (now / next / today).
- **Movies (VOD)** and **Series** library with poster grids, detail dialogs, and season / episode navigation.
- **Full schedule grid** on the EPG page, with timezone-aware "all times local" rendering.
- **Picture-in-picture** and a Video.js-powered player tuned for HLS.
- **Multiple playlists**, switchable from the sidebar without re-entering credentials.
- **TV-first navigation.** Spatial focus (D-pad / arrow keys) is wired across the whole app via `spatial-navigation-polyfill`. Hit targets, focus rings, and reflow tested for 10-foot UI.
- **Light and dark themes**, both first-class. Honours `prefers-color-scheme`, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and `prefers-contrast`.
- **Adjustable font scale** (Default / Medium / Large / X-Large) plus a responsive root size that scales the whole UI on 4K and 8K displays.
- **Self-updating Windows desktop build** via the Tauri updater (signed with minisign, served from GitHub Releases).
- **Offline-friendly persistence.** Credentials and preferences live in the OS app-data dir on Tauri builds, with a localStorage / cookie fallback on the web build.

### via winget

The Microsoft Store listing is federated through `winget`, so you can install without opening the Store:

```powershell
winget install --id 9NN162Z0WXSR --source msstore
```

## Develop

Requirements: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (the package manager is pinned in `package.json`), Node 20+, the Rust toolchain (only for `tauri` commands), and Android Studio for `tauri:android`.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                  # Astro + Svelte at http://localhost:4321
pnpm tauri dev            # Native Windows / desktop shell (auto-spawns pnpm dev)
pnpm tauri:android        # Android dev shell
```

The Astro dev server's HMR `host` is hardcoded to a LAN IP in `astro.config.mjs`. Update or remove that block if dev HMR fails on your machine.

There are no tests, linters, or formatters configured. TypeScript is in strict mode (`tsconfig.json` extends `astro/tsconfigs/strict`); the `@/*` alias maps to `src/*`.
